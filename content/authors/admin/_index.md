Welcome! I am a mathematician working in the area of Rough Analysis, (singular) stochastic PDEs, and mathematical Quantum Field Theory, especially Stochastic Quantisation. I am currently based at the University of Oxford where I am supported by a UKRI Postdoctoral Fellowship (in guarantee of a Marie Curie Fellowship). My mentor is <a href="https://mgubi.github.io/docs/main.html">Massimiliano Gubinelli</a>. Before moving to Oxford, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the group of <a href="https://giuseppecannizzaro.weebly.com">Giuseppe Cannizzaro</a> at the University of Warwick. I completed my doctorate at TU Berlin, Germany, under the supervision of <a href="https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~friz/">Peter K. Friz</a>. I was also a fellow of the Berlin Mathematical School.
