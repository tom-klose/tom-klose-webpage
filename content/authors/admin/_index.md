Welcome! I am a mathematician working in the area of Rough Analysis, (singular) stochastic PDEs, and mathematical Quantum Field Theory, especially Stochastic Quantisation. I am currently based at the University of Warwick, United Kingdom, where I am postdoctoral researcher in the group of <a href="https://giuseppecannizzaro.weebly.com">Giuseppe Cannizzaro</a>. Before that, I completed my doctorate at Technische Universität Berlin, Germany, under the supervision of <a href="https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~friz/">Peter K. Friz</a>. I was also a fellow of the Berlin Mathematical School.
